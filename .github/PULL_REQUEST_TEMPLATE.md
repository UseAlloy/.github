* The pull request must have a Clubhouse ticket attached. We're trying to make sure all changes are requested and tracked, so make sure there is a ticket!
* The pull request must update the test suite to exercise the updated functionality. CodeCov will post on your PR after creation to show what the coverage diff is.
* After you create the pull request, all status checks must be pass before a maintainer reviews your contribution.

## Context/Background

Include any context not present in the ticket. If your change touches many areas of the code, include an overview of those areas.

### Description of the Change

<!--

We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts.

### Possible Drawbacks

<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->

## Steps To Test

<!--

What process did you follow to verify that your change has the desired effects?

- How did you verify that all new functionality works as expected?
- How did you verify that all changed functionality works as expected?
- How did you verify that the change has not introduced any regressions?

Describe the actions you performed (including buttons you clicked, text you typed, commands you ran, etc.), and describe the results you observed.

This lets reviewers check that you've considered all the cases your code could touch.

Notes:

Try to keep your PR under 500 LOC. If your change is large, group it into PRs based on logical areas (adding a component, adding an API endpoint, etc).
